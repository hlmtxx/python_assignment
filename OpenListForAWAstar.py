'''
This file contains implementations for a binary heap-based PriorityQueue as well as a Stack.
The PriorityQueue implementation allows you to update the priority of a state that is already
in the Queue, keeping whichever entry has a lower accumulated cost.  Adding a state is still
acheived in constant time.
